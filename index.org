* Never Exercise and American Call on a Non-Dividend Paying Stock

Consider two portfolios:

1.  Buy share of stock

2. 
 a. Buy zero-coupon bond with X par
 b. Buy call option with X strike


Payoff:

Portfolio 1:
|       | $S_T > X$ | $S_T < X$ |
|-------+-----------+-----------|
| S_T   | S_T       | S_T       |
|-------+-----------+-----------|
| Total | S_T       | S_T       |


Portfolio 2:
|       | $S_T > X$ | $S_T < X$ |
|-------+-----------+-----------|
| C     | $S_T - X$ | 0         |
| Bond  | X         | X         |
|-------+-----------+-----------|
| Total | $S_T$     | X         |

=> We will pay more for portfolio 2.

$C_0 + \frac{X}{1+r} > S_0 \rightarrow C_0  > max(S_0 - \frac{X}{1+r}, 0) > max(S_0 - X, 0)$

American Call >= European Call

Non-Dividend Paying:
American Call = European Call

* What About an American Put on a Non-Dividend Paying Stock?

You may exercise the put prior to expiration.  Why?
